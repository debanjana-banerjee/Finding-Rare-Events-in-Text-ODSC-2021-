### Finding Rare Events in Text (Intermediate-Advanced)
#### 90 minutes Hands on Workshop
#### ODSC 2021

#### Abstract: 

The session will focus on identifying rare events in text with positive unlabeled data. PU learners are massively used for one-class classification but the challenge becomes far steeper when the event under consideration has low probability of occurrence. We will discuss a novel algorithm (iCASSTLe) included in IEEE ICMLA 2018 where we use a two-staged semi-supervised approach to extract the relevant recall set using core components of NLP. By the end of this workshop, you will get a basic understanding of the following

- Difference b/w rare events & anomalies
- Basics of Text Mining
- Motivation behind Semi Supervised Learners
- Training PU Learners for Rare Events
